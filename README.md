Hi, I'm @saggitar :v:

_I like_

- coffee with syntactic sugar
- games
- [numpy.einsum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html) and I'm not afraid to use it

*I am hoping to at some point have enough mathematical understanding to finally get a grasp of Gauge theory. #nothappening  
Meanwhile I am namedropping "Lie Group" and "Euler Lagrange" until somebody notices I am just making stuff up...*
